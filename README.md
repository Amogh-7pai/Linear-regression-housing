# 🏡 House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This project uses **linear regression** to predict house prices based on features like area, bedrooms, furnishing status, and more.

## 📌 Steps Involved

1. Load and explore the dataset (`Housing.csv`)
2. Encode categorical variables
3. Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)
4. Train a linear regression model
5. Evaluate using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score
6. Visualize predictions and residuals

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Outcome

The model shows good predictive performance with meaningful visualizations (Actual vs Predicted & Residuals). Suitable for extending to more complex models.
